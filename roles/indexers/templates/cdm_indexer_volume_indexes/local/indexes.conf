# VOLUME SETTINGS
# In this example, the volume spec here is set to the indexer-specific
# path for data storage. It satisfies the "volume:primary" tag used in
# the indexes.conf which is shared between SH and indexers. 
# See also: cdm_all_indexes

# One Volume for Hot and Cold
[volume:primary]
path = /opt/splunk/var/lib/splunk/
# Note: The *only* reason to use a volume is to set a cumulative size-based
# limit across several indexes stored on the same partition. There are *not*
# time-based volume limits.
# ~4 TB
maxVolumeDataSizeMB = 4000000

# This setting changes the storage location for _splunk_summaries, 
# which should be utilized if you want to use the same partition
# as specified for volume settings. Otherwise defaults to $SPLUNK_DB.

# path = /path/to/index/storage/partition
